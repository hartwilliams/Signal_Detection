This is a programming assignment I did for CSDS 364: Computational Perception. The focus of the assignment was detecting simple signals in noise. I completed the assignment in Jupyter notebook, writing code in Python with libraries such as Matplotlib and NumPy, and writing explanations in Markdown with LaTeX for mathematical formulas. The function output may contain some errors.
